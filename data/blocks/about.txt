<h2>About eatStatic</h2>

<p>eatStatic is a text file driven blog engine written by veteran blogger <a href="http://www.rickhurst.co.uk">Rick Hurst</a>, which allows you to write blog posts as text files on your computer, then post to your blog using either FTP, sFTP, GIT, SVN or any other mechanism that allows you to upload files to a server.</p>

<p>It was originally written as a means of maintaining a travel blog offline with limited internet connectivity, but it has since proved to be an attractive alternative to wordpress, powering Rick's personal blog, with 600+ posts spanning a decade</a>.

<p>This site serves as a demo site, documentation site and progress blog</p>
