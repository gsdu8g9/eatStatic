	<h2>About Camper Van Things blog</h2>

	<p><img src="/images/misc/campsite_working_wide_700.png" alt="working from a campsite in france" /></p>

	<p>This is a blog written by me, <a href="http://www.rickhurst.co.uk">Rick Hurst</a>, about my experiences working as a web developer on the move. Started as a travel blog in 2010, it contains insights into working on the road, equipment, tools, camping, camper vans, experiences and places.</p> 

	<p>I am based in Bristol, UK and work as a web developer. Working always from a laptop, often in cafes and shared studio space, and sometimes from my car, camper or tent on camping trips. I live in the beautiful city of Bristol, Uk, with my beautiful wife and son.</p>

	<h3>Sponsorship and advertising</h3>
	<p>This is a self-funded blog and i'm not paid to review any of the equipment, campsites or cafes mentioned. However, I would love to hear of any opportunities, if you have any kit or places that you would like reviewed. I'm also happy to consider sponsorship from relevant companies, in the form of advertising, to help cover hosting and maintenance costs.</p>

	<h3>About eatStatic blog software</h3>
	<p>This blog runs on a simple piece of open source blogging software that I created for keeping a travel blog - it runs from text files rather than a database, so blog posts can easily be written while offline, then uploaded when an internet connection is available. For more information see <a href="http://eatstatic.olivewoodstudio.com">the eatStatic blog software website</a>.
