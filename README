IMPORTANT: feel free to use this code, but don't dive in and expect the example site 
to work just yet, i'm just in the process of collating code from different sites
and setting up a working demo!

This is a PHP5 microframework that mainly uses static text files and json files
for storage. It evolved from a number of different projects and thought it 
would be useful to formalise it a bit and make it available as open source.

It is intended as a "drop in" library to provide useful functionality to an existing PHP 
site. Also included is an example site with a simple front controller that shows how it can be 
used to build a web site, and an "admin site" which contains admin tools. The intention is
that the admin site will eventually contain some automatically generated admin forms for 
editing different page types (e.g. "generic page", "case study")

As for data storage - the text file driven blog example was put together to allow me to
maintain a travel blog (http://ontheroad.rickhurst.co.uk) with limited internet connectivity -
blog posts were written in textmate/ emacs and uploaded to the server when a connection was available.
The json file storage idea was put together for another project - I didn't want to go down the mysql 
route and it just seemed like a blindingly simple idea to save php object instances to the filesystem
using json_encode. This works really well, but probably won't scale very well, so i'm now looking at 
providing switchable mongodb support for larger/ higher traffic applications.
